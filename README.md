## Create a weather station with a Raspberry pi!

### Audience
 * This project is a work in progress, and is not ready for a user to download and use as is
 * It is mainly intended as a hobby for myself and a basis to assist me in learning software development
 * This software is being actively used to report my local weather conditions to http://www.wxqa.com/
 * I have packaged a release into a .deb package for use with Raspberry pi OS, and it should work if the same hardware is being used. I plan on releasing a .rpm build for Fedora 35 server on the Raspberry pi in the near future.

### Usage
 * Anyone can use my code from this repository under the GPL v3 that is attached to this repository
 * All libraries used in this project are bound to their individual license agreements, that I will be adding to LICENSES folder very soon

 ### Inspiration for this project
 * I was inspired to create this project after reading this article: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-your-own-weather-station
 * However I wanted my code to do more than locally log data. I also wanted my data to be used by a larger group if possible, which I have done by incorporating aprs messasing ability which I use to participate as a station in [WXQA](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-your-own-weather-station)
 * I also wanted to add other capabilities such as gathering and reporting AQI readings

 ### Hardware used
  * TODO
