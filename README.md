## Create a weather station with a Raspberry pi!

Currently I'm using [Raspberry Pi OS lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) but eventually I plan to make a script to setup an environment for [Arch Linux Arm](https://archlinuxarm.org/).

### Hardware Components
1. [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) or [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/)
    * The onboard wifi for the Raspberry Pi Zero W is likely not strong enough for longer distances and barriers.
1. Highly recommended [Bingfu Dual Band WiFi 2.4GHz 5GHz 5.8GHz 9dBi Magnetic Base RP-SMA Male Antenna](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MG6ZXCD/ref=twister_B08BDG1R51?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)
1. [Alfa AWUS036ACS 802.11ac AC600 Wi-Fi Wireless Network Adapter](https://www.alfa.com.tw/products/awus036acs)
1. [Waveshare BME280 Environmental Sensor, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure Detection Module I2C/SPI Interface](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P4CWGGK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
1. [DollaTek PM Sensor SDS011 High Precision PM2.5 Air Quality Detection Sensor Module Super Dust Sensors Digital Output](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M6JWCWQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
1. Waterproof electronics box with cable glands, [like this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FT1H2RZ/ref=twister_B08GG2HGTB?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

### Optional POE equipment can be used with ethernet adapter
1. [48V POE Injector Adapter Power Supply,10/100Mbps IEEE 802.3af Compliant](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DHWHQT8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
1. [UCTRONICS IEEE 802.3af Micro USB Active PoE Splitter Power Over Ethernet 48V to 5V 2.4A for Tablets, Dropcam or Raspberry Pi (48V to 5V 2.4A)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MDLUSE7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
1. [SunFounder Power Supply Module for Raspberry Pi UPS with Recharging Function 5V/3A Lithium Battery Power Pack Expansion Board for Raspberry Pi 4B 3B+ 3B/2B and 1 Model B+](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HLXGS3W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
	* It maybe possible to run completely from battery power and a solar panel. However power optimizations, two 3000 or 3500 mHA batteries, a large solar panel, and a Raspberry pi zero would be ideal for this.

### Primary Packages Used
* [bme280pi](https://pypi.org/project/bme280pi/)
